- **Wave 3 (Dec 2025):**  
  Applied ρ(t) to real collapse case studies (Enron email, The DAO, Reddit r/The_Donald).  
  In all three, ρ stayed green/yellow in normal operation, drifted into orange, and entered red within ~1–6 months of failure.  
  Also introduced an optional N-scaled view,
  ρ_eff = ρ / ln(N / 100),
  which reconciles web-scale high-ρ stability with small-scale high-ρ brittleness.
